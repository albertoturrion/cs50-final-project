            <h2>Why English Inmersion?</h2>
            <p>When I started to learn English, <b>I felt I wasn’t moving forward</b>. After making some test by myself, I realized <b>I should learn only in English</b>, avoiding the translation from English to Spanish - my native language - or vice-versa.</p>
            <p>Because of this, I decided to make this app to <b>help other people in the same situation</b>, providing some resources and techniques which have been extremely useful for me.</p>
            <p><b>You should learn English in English</b>, although sometimes it will help you to understand the word in Spanish and then, translate it to English. However, as the aim is thinking in English, <b>I urge you to do all possible in English</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Search in Google in English.</li>
                <li>Write daily messages in English.</li>
                <li>Watch series in English (you can activate subtitles in English).</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Keep your motivation</h2>
        <p>At the start of learning English, probably you will realize that you are moving forward fast.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it’s likely you get frustrated while learning English if you have an intermediate level, so <b>you should look for strong motivations</b> and remember them to yourself in the bad moments.</p>
        <p>Make a list of reasons that motivate you to learn, for instance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Being promoted in your job.</li>
            <li>Travelling around the world.</li>
            <li>Being able to do courses in English with full comprehension.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should make your own list. In any case, it is important to remember the following sentence:</p>
        <p class="motivation-phrase"><b>When motivation fails you, discipline takes over.</b></p>
